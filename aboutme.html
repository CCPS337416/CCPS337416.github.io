    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>  I am working toward going to flight attendance school to become a flight attendance. For my personal life I want to have a decent house that I can life in by myself. The experience that has helped me get here are traveling the world with my aunt and exploring new places at least once a year.   I am working toward these goals by trying to finish Highschool. I'm also working on these goals reading books about fight attending.
 The values that I consider necessary for me to be a fight attendant is finishing high school.  
 I hope to accomplish many goals and one of them is giving my mom a house that she has always wanted. 
 I want to be known has successful and someone that lots of people look up to and they wanna be like me.</p>
